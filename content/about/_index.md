Great Engineering is born out of three things: creative problem solving, experienced decision making, and good team communication. I seek to bring all three to the table.

##### Creative Problem Solving
The software world is constantly evolving. Every year, countless new languages, frameworks, libraries, architectural paradigm, security concern, and saas businesses shift the technological landscape. Staying informed on the state of the art let's business combine technologies in novel, value-creating ways.

I've gone through the engineering process with dozens of companies, from seed-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies.

##### Experienced Decision Making
Good software is the product of a sequence of good decisions being made on a daily basis. If, at any point, a poor decisions are made, their costs will compound over time. The ability to recognizes the long-term effects of these decisions is what differentiates good engineers from great engineers. When working on any project, I strive to understand and address the long term implications of software patterns. Surfacing and discussing these implications with technical and business stakeholder is of the utmost importance.


##### Good Communication
A project cannot be successful without excellent communication between engineers and stakeholders. On a basic level, good communication requires:

- Clearly translating technical concepts, pros and cons to stakeholders with different technical knowledge
* Maintaing regular, if not daily, updates on the progress of a project
* Creating and keeping up to date great documentation and timelines for ongoing projects

 However, when creating software, communication skills goes beyond traditional metrics. Good code isn't merely code that works, but code that is easy to understand and to modify. I consider the following to be <b>good engineering communication</b>:

* Ensuring excellent code readiblity - define a standard, such as PEP8, and stick to it
* Writing unit tests so that others may safely edit your code
* Being concise when submitting pull requests. (If you aren't using pull requests, start now)
* Modularize to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
* Taking the time to answer your collaborators' questions.
